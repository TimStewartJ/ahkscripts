# AHK Scripts

This is a repo for my personal AHK scripts. 

## The scripts:

`middlemouseup.ahk`: Goes up a directory in the file explorer when the middle mouse button is pressed.

`bedwars.ahk`: 
 - `CTRL-J` requeues for doubles.
 - `CTRL-K` does `/who`.
 
`startup.ahk`: Does nothing but start other scripts. Useful for putting in the Windows startup folder instead of doing each script separately. Current startup script list:
 - `middlemouseup.ahk`
 - `bedwars.ahk`
